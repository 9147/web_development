    <p align="justify">Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the ability of an artificial entity to solve complicated problems using its own intelligence. Computer science and physiology are combined in Artificial Intelligence. In layman's terms, intelligence is the computational component of one's capacity to attain goals in the real world. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to think, envision, memorize, and comprehend, see patterns, make decisions, adapt to change, and learn from experience. Artificial intelligence is focused with making computers behave more human-like and in a fraction of the time it takes a person to do it. As a result, it is known as Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is also concerned with pushing the boundaries of practical computer science in the direction of systems that are adaptable, flexible, and capable of forming their own analyses and solution techniques by applying general knowledge to specific situations.</p>
    <p>Machine or software intelligence is referred to as artificial intelligence. Perceive + Analyze + React = Intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a subject of computer science that is rapidly gaining popularity since it has improved human existence in a variety of ways. Artificial intelligence has substantially enhanced the performance of manufacturing and service systems during the previous two decades. Expert systems are a fast emerging technology that originated from artificial intelligence research. Intelligent machines will replace or augment human capabilities in many sectors in the future.</p>
